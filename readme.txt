Migrate custom fields from Toolset to Meta Box.

== Description ==

This tool helps you migrate custom fields from Toolset to Meta Box.

**Meta Box is a powerful, professional, and lightweight toolkit for developers to create custom meta boxes and custom fields for any custom post type in WordPress.**

> **Meta Box Lite**
> We recommend using [Meta Box Lite](https://metabox.io/lite/), a feature-rich free UI version of Meta Box that provides UI and all free features for managing custom fields and dynamic content on WordPress, including post types, taxonomies, custom fields, and relationships.

Switching from Toolset to Meta Box gives you lots of benefits:

- A wide-range of field types and options. Meta Box supports [40+ built-in WordPress custom field types](https://docs.metabox.io/field-settings/) for all your needs. You can also [effortlessly create your own field type](https://docs.metabox.io/creating-new-field-types/).
- Meta Box supports cloning fields for most field types including the WYSIWYG editor field. It also supports [repeatable field groups](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-group/).
- Meta Box has an ultra-lightweight, yet powerful API that won't overload your site.
- Meta Box uses the [native WordPress meta data storage](https://docs.metabox.io/database/) and functions for ease of use and lightning-fast processing.
- Meta Box has a ton of [free and premium extensions](https://metabox.io/plugins/) available to further extend the already powerful core Meta Box plugin so you can supercharge your custom fields in WordPress.
